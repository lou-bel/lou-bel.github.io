                <p class="label">The Honey Bee</p>
                <p>This balloon is a long-standing favorite at the Balloon Fiesta. It is one of three Bee ballons which form a Bee family, including a Mom, Dad, and two Baby Bee balloons.</p>

                <p class="label">The Yoda</p>
                <p>This balloon, thought technically a 'special shape balloon,' is small enought that it often takes flight.</p>

                <img src="assets/img/shape3.JPG" alt="">
                <p class="label">The Christ the Redeemer</p>
                <p>This balloon is quite large, and therefore does not normally take flight, but is inflated on the ground for people to see. </p>

                <img src="assets/img/shape4.JPG" alt="">
                <p class="label">The Wells Fargo Carriage</p>
                <p>This special shape balloon is one of the oldest of the Fiesta, and is often one of the first to inflate.</p>
